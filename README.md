# @graphile/pg-aggregates

Adds a powerful suite of aggregate functionality to a PostGraphile schema:
calculating aggregates, grouped aggregates, applying conditions to grouped
aggregates, ordering by relational aggregates, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: aggregates are added to connections, they do _not_ work with
"simple collections".

## Status

This module is currently "experimental" status; we may change any part of it in
a semver minor release.

## Usage

Requires PostGraphile v4.12.0-alpha.0 or higher.

Install with:

```
yarn add postgraphile @graphile/pg-aggregates
```

CLI usage via `--append-plugins`:

```
postgraphile --append-plugins @graphile/pg-aggregates -c postgres://localhost/my_db ...
```

Library usage via `applyPlugins`:

```ts
import PgAggregatesPlugin from "@graphile/pg-aggregates";
// or: const PgAggregatesPlugin = require("@graphile/pg-aggregates").default;

const middleware = postgraphile(DATABASE_URL, SCHEMAS, {
  appendPlugins: [PgAggregatesPlugin],
});
```

If you want you could install our [example schema](__tests__/schema.sql) and
then issue a GraphQL query such as:

```graphql
query GameAggregates {
  allMatchStats {
    aggregates {
      max {
        points
        goals
        saves
      }
      min {
        points
      }
    }
  }
  allPlayers(orderBy: [MATCH_STATS_BY_PLAYER_ID_SUM_GOALS_ASC]) {
    nodes {
      name
      matchStatsByPlayerId {
        totalCount
        aggregates {
          sum {
            points
            goals
            saves
          }
          average {
            points
            goals
            saves
            teamPosition
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

or:

```graphql
query GroupedAggregatesByDerivative {
  allMatchStats {
    byDay: groupedAggregates(groupBy: [CREATED_AT_TRUNCATED_TO_DAY]) {
      keys # The timestamp truncated to the beginning of the day
      average {
        points
      }
    }
    byHour: groupedAggregates(groupBy: [CREATED_AT_TRUNCATED_TO_HOUR]) {
      keys # The timestamp truncated to the beginning of the hour
      average {
        points
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Interaction with connection parameters

Aggregates respect the conditions/filters of the connection but are unaffected
by the pagination of the connection (they ignore the
`first`/`last`/`after`/`before`/`orderBy` parameters). You may retrieve
(optionally paginated) node data from a connection at the same time as
retrieving aggregates from it. Aggregates are supported on connections at any
level of the GraphQL query.

## Aggregates

Connection-wide aggregates are available via the `aggregates` field directly on
a GraphQL connection; for example:

```graphql
query LoadsOfAggregates {
  allFilms {
    aggregates {
      average {
        durationInMinutes
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We support the following aggregates out of the box:

- `sum` (applies to number-like fields) - the result of adding all the values
  together
- `distinctCount` (applies to all fields) - the count of the number of distinct
  values
- `min` (applies to number-like fields) - the smallest value
- `max` (applies to number-like fields) - the greatest value
- `average` (applies to number-like fields) - the average (arithmetic mean)
  value
- `stddevSample` (applies to number-like fields) - the sample standard deviation
  of the values
- `stddevPopulation` (applies to number-like fields) - the population standard
  deviation of the values
- `varianceSample` (applies to number-like fields) - the sample variance of the
  values
- `variancePopulation` (applies to number-like fields) - the population variance
  of the values

See [Defining your own aggregates](#defining-your-own-aggregates) below for
details on how to add your own aggregates.

Different aggregates apply to different data types; in general we attempt to add
aggregate entries for each column and
[computed column function](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/computed-columns/)
that appears to be compatible with the aggregate.

## Ordering by aggregates

This plugin automatically adds some additional `orderBy` criteria to your graph
allowing you to order by aggregates over relations; e.g. you could find the top
5 players ordered by their average points scored in each match, and grab some
more aggregate information about them too:

```graphql
query FocussedOrderedAggregate {
  allPlayers(
    first: 5
    orderBy: [MATCH_STATS_BY_PLAYER_ID_AVERAGE_POINTS_DESC]
  ) {
    nodes {
      name
      matchStatsByPlayerId {
        totalCount
        aggregates {
          sum {
            goals
          }
          average {
            points
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Grouped aggregates

We also support grouping your data via the value of one of your columns,
no-additional-arguments computed columns, or a derivative thereof; and
calculating aggregates over each of the matching groups. Out of the box we
support two derivatives:

- `truncated-to-hour` (applies to timestamp-like values) - truncates to the
  beginning of the (UTC) hour
- `truncated-to-day` (applies to timestamp-like values) - truncates to the
  beginning of the (UTC) day

See
[Defining your own grouping derivatives](#defining-your-own-grouping-derivatives)
below for details on how to add your own grouping derivatives.

The aggregates supported over groups are the same as over the connection as a
whole (see [Aggregates](#aggregates) above), but in addition you may also
determine the `keys` that were used for the aggregate. There will be one key for
each of the `groupBy` values; for example in this query:

```graphql
query AverageDurationByYearOfRelease {
  allFilms {
    groupedAggregates(groupBy: [YEAR_OF_RELEASE]) {
      keys
      average {
        durationInMinutes
      }
    }
  }
}
```

each entry in the `groupedAggregates` result will have a `keys` entry that will
be a list containing one value which will be the year of release (as a string).
The values in the `keys` list are always stringified, this is a known limitation
due to interactions with GraphQL.

### Having

If these grouped aggregates are returning too much data, you can filter the
groups down by applying a `having` clause against them; for example you could
see the average number of goals on days where the average points score was over
200:

```graphql
query AverageGoalsOnDaysWithAveragePointsOver200 {
  allMatchStats {
    byDay: groupedAggregates(
      groupBy: [CREATED_AT_TRUNCATED_TO_DAY]
      having: { average: { points: { greaterThan: 200 } } }
    ) {
      keys
      average {
        goals
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Defining your own aggregates

You can add your own aggregates by using a plugin to add your own aggregate
specs. Aggregate specs aren't too complicated, for example here is a spec that
could define the "min" aggregate:

```ts
const isNumberLike = (pgType) => pgType.category === "N";

const minSpec = {
  id: "min",
  humanLabel: "minimum",
  HumanLabel: "Minimum",
  isSuitableType: isNumberLike,
  sqlAggregateWrap: (sqlFrag, pgType) => sql.fragment`min(${sqlFrag})`,
};
```

Note that the attribute's pgType is passed to `sqlAggregateWrap` so the
query fragment can be altered depending on the attribute. This is useful for
making decisions about suitable default values, or to even use different
aggregate functions for different types.

See [src/AggregateSpecsPlugin.ts](src/AggregateSpecsPlugin.ts) for more
details/examples.

## Defining your own grouping derivatives

You may add your own derivatives by adding a group by spec; see
[src/AggregateSpecsPlugin.ts](src/AggregateSpecsPlugin.ts) for examples and more
information. Derivative specs are also fairly straightforward:

```ts
const TIMESTAMP_OID = "1114";
const TIMESTAMPTZ_OID = "1184";

const truncatedToHourSpec = {
  id: "truncated-to-hour",
  isSuitableType: (pgType) =>
    pgType.id === TIMESTAMP_OID || pgType.id === TIMESTAMPTZ_OID,
  sqlWrap: (sqlFrag) => sql.fragment`date_trunc('hour', ${sqlFrag})`,
};
```

## Thanks

This plugin was started as a proof of concept in 2019 thanks to sponsorship from
OneGraph, and was made into fully featured released module thanks to sponsorship
from Surge in 2021. It is maintained thanks to the support of
[Graphile's sponsors](https://graphile.org/sponsor/) - thank you sponsors!
