# @graphile/pg-aggregates

Adds a powerful suite of aggregate functionality to a PostGraphile schema:
calculating aggregates, grouped aggregates, applying conditions to grouped
aggregates, ordering by relational aggregates, filtering by the results of
aggregates on related connections, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: aggregates are added to connections, they do _not_ work with
"simple collections".

## Status

This module is currently "experimental" status; we may change any part of it in
a semver minor release.

## Usage

Requires PostGraphile v4.12.0-alpha.0 or higher.

Install with:

```
yarn add postgraphile @graphile/pg-aggregates
```

CLI usage via `--append-plugins`:

```
postgraphile --append-plugins @graphile/pg-aggregates -c postgres://localhost/my_db ...
```

Library usage via `appendPlugins`:

```ts
import PgAggregatesPlugin from "@graphile/pg-aggregates";
// or: const PgAggregatesPlugin = require("@graphile/pg-aggregates").default;

const middleware = postgraphile(DATABASE_URL, SCHEMAS, {
  appendPlugins: [PgAggregatesPlugin],
});
```

If you want you could install our [example schema](__tests__/schema.sql) and
then issue a GraphQL query such as:

```graphql
query GameAggregates {
  allMatchStats {
    aggregates {
      max {
        points
        goals
        saves
      }
      min {
        points
      }
    }
  }
  allPlayers(orderBy: [MATCH_STATS_BY_PLAYER_ID_SUM_GOALS_ASC]) {
    nodes {
      name
      matchStatsByPlayerId {
        totalCount
        aggregates {
          sum {
            points
            goals
            saves
          }
          average {
            points
            goals
            saves
            teamPosition
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

or:

```graphql
query GroupedAggregatesByDerivative {
  allMatchStats {
    byDay: groupedAggregates(groupBy: [CREATED_AT_TRUNCATED_TO_DAY]) {
      keys # The timestamp truncated to the beginning of the day
      average {
        points
      }
    }
    byHour: groupedAggregates(groupBy: [CREATED_AT_TRUNCATED_TO_HOUR]) {
      keys # The timestamp truncated to the beginning of the hour
      average {
        points
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To filter by aggregates on related tables, you will also need
[postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter](https://github.com/graphile-contrib/postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter),
and you will need to enable `graphileBuildOptions.connectionFilterRelations`
[as documented here](https://github.com/graphile-contrib/postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter#connectionfilterrelations).

```js
app.use(
  postgraphile(DATABASE_URL, SCHEMA_NAME, {
    graphileBuildOptions: {
      connectionFilterRelations: true,
    },
  })
);
```

## Interaction with connection parameters

Aggregates respect the conditions/filters of the connection but are unaffected
by the pagination of the connection (they ignore the
`first`/`last`/`after`/`before`/`orderBy` parameters). You may retrieve
(optionally paginated) node data from a connection at the same time as
retrieving aggregates from it. Aggregates are supported on connections at any
level of the GraphQL query.

## Aggregates

Connection-wide aggregates are available via the `aggregates` field directly on
a GraphQL connection; for example:

```graphql
query LoadsOfAggregates {
  allFilms {
    aggregates {
      average {
        durationInMinutes
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We support the following aggregates out of the box:

- `sum` (applies to number-like fields) - the result of adding all the values
  together
- `distinctCount` (applies to all fields) - the count of the number of distinct
  values
- `min` (applies to number-like fields) - the smallest value
- `max` (applies to number-like fields) - the greatest value
- `average` (applies to number-like fields) - the average (arithmetic mean)
  value
- `stddevSample` (applies to number-like fields) - the sample standard deviation
  of the values
- `stddevPopulation` (applies to number-like fields) - the population standard
  deviation of the values
- `varianceSample` (applies to number-like fields) - the sample variance of the
  values
- `variancePopulation` (applies to number-like fields) - the population variance
  of the values

See [Defining your own aggregates](#defining-your-own-aggregates) below for
details on how to add your own aggregates.

Different aggregates apply to different data types; in general we attempt to add
aggregate entries for each column and
[computed column function](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/computed-columns/)
that appears to be compatible with the aggregate.

## Ordering by aggregates

This plugin automatically adds some additional `orderBy` criteria to your graph
allowing you to order by aggregates over relations; e.g. you could find the top
5 players ordered by their average points scored in each match, and grab some
more aggregate information about them too:

```graphql
query FocussedOrderedAggregate {
  allPlayers(
    first: 5
    orderBy: [MATCH_STATS_BY_PLAYER_ID_AVERAGE_POINTS_DESC]
  ) {
    nodes {
      name
      matchStatsByPlayerId {
        totalCount
        aggregates {
          sum {
            goals
          }
          average {
            points
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Filtering by aggregates

(You will need `postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter` for this; see above.)

```graphql
query PlayersWith9OrMoreSavesInMatchesTheyScoredIn {
  allPlayers(
    filter: {
      matchStatsByPlayerId: {
        aggregates: {
          sum: { saves: { greaterThan: "9" }, rating: { lessThan: 143 } }
          filter: { goals: { greaterThan: 0 } }
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    nodes {
      name
      matchStatsByPlayerId(filter: { goals: { greaterThan: 0 } }) {
        aggregates {
          sum {
            saves
            rating
            goals
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Grouped aggregates

We also support grouping your data via the value of one of your columns or a
derivative thereof; and calculating aggregates over each of the matching groups.
Out of the box we support two derivatives:

- `truncated-to-hour` (applies to timestamp-like values) - truncates to the
  beginning of the (UTC) hour
- `truncated-to-day` (applies to timestamp-like values) - truncates to the
  beginning of the (UTC) day

See
[Defining your own grouping derivatives](#defining-your-own-grouping-derivatives)
below for details on how to add your own grouping derivatives.

The aggregates supported over groups are the same as over the connection as a
whole (see [Aggregates](#aggregates) above), but in addition you may also
determine the `keys` that were used for the aggregate. There will be one key for
each of the `groupBy` values; for example in this query:

```graphql
query AverageDurationByYearOfRelease {
  allFilms {
    groupedAggregates(groupBy: [YEAR_OF_RELEASE]) {
      keys
      average {
        durationInMinutes
      }
    }
  }
}
```

each entry in the `groupedAggregates` result will have a `keys` entry that will
be a list containing one value which will be the year of release (as a string).
The values in the `keys` list are always stringified, this is a known limitation
due to interactions with GraphQL.

### Having

If these grouped aggregates are returning too much data, you can filter the
groups down by applying a `having` clause against them; for example you could
see the average number of goals on days where the average points score was over
200:

```graphql
query AverageGoalsOnDaysWithAveragePointsOver200 {
  allMatchStats {
    byDay: groupedAggregates(
      groupBy: [CREATED_AT_TRUNCATED_TO_DAY]
      having: { average: { points: { greaterThan: 200 } } }
    ) {
      keys
      average {
        goals
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Defining your own aggregates

You can add your own aggregates by using a plugin to add your own aggregate
specs. Aggregate specs aren't too complicated, for example here is a spec that
could define the "min" aggregate:

```ts
const isNumberLike = (pgType) => pgType.category === "N";

const minSpec = {
  id: "min",
  humanLabel: "minimum",
  HumanLabel: "Minimum",
  isSuitableType: isNumberLike,
  sqlAggregateWrap: (sqlFrag) => sql.fragment`min(${sqlFrag})`,
};
```

See [src/AggregateSpecsPlugin.ts](src/AggregateSpecsPlugin.ts) for more
details/examples.

## Defining your own grouping derivatives

You may add your own derivatives by adding a group by spec to
`build.pgAggregateGroupBySpecs` via a plugin. Derivative specs are fairly
straightforward, for example here's the spec for "truncated-to-hour":

```ts
const TIMESTAMP_OID = "1114";
const TIMESTAMPTZ_OID = "1184";

const truncatedToHourSpec = {
  // A unique identifier for this spec, will be used to generate its name:
  id: "truncated-to-hour",

  // A filter to determine which column/function return types this derivative
  // is valid against:
  isSuitableType: (pgType) =>
    pgType.id === TIMESTAMP_OID || pgType.id === TIMESTAMPTZ_OID,

  // The actual derivative - given the SQL fragment `sqlFrag` which represents
  // the column/function call, return a new SQL fragment that represents the
  // derived value, in this case a truncated timestamp:
  sqlWrap: (sqlFrag) => sql.fragment`date_trunc('hour', ${sqlFrag})`,
};
```

Building that up with a few more different intervals into a full PostGraphile
plugin, you might write something like:

```ts
// Constants from PostgreSQL
const TIMESTAMP_OID = "1114";
const TIMESTAMPTZ_OID = "1184";

// Determine if a given type is a timestamp/timestamptz
const isTimestamp = (pgType) =>
  pgType.id === TIMESTAMP_OID || pgType.id === TIMESTAMPTZ_OID;

// Build a spec that truncates to the given interval
const tsTruncateSpec = (sql, interval) => ({
  // `id` has to be unique, derive it from the `interval`:
  id: `truncated-to-${interval}`,

  // Only apply to timestamp fields:
  isSuitableType: isTimestamp,

  // Given the column value represented by the SQL fragment `sqlFrag`, wrap it
  // with a `date_trunc()` call, passing the relevant interval.
  sqlWrap: (sqlFrag) =>
    sql.fragment`date_trunc(${sql.literal(interval)}, ${sqlFrag})`,
});

// This is the PostGraphile plugin; see:
// https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/extending/
const DateTruncAggregateGroupSpecsPlugin = (builder) => {
  builder.hook("build", (build) => {
    const { pgSql: sql } = build;

    build.pgAggregateGroupBySpecs = [
      // Copy all existing specs, except the ones we're replacing
      ...build.pgAggregateGroupBySpecs.filter(
        (spec) => !["truncated-to-day", "truncated-to-hour"].includes(spec.id)
      ),

      // Add our timestamp specs
      tsTruncateSpec(sql, "year"),
      tsTruncateSpec(sql, "month"),
      tsTruncateSpec(sql, "week"),
      tsTruncateSpec(sql, "day"),
      tsTruncateSpec(sql, "hour"),
      // Other values: microseconds, milliseconds, second, minute, quarter,
      // decade, century, millennium.
      // See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-TRUNC
    ];

    return build;
  });
};

module.exports = DateTruncAggregateGroupSpecsPlugin;
```

Finally pass this plugin into PostGraphile via `--append-plugins` or
`appendPlugins: [...]` - see https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/extending/

See [src/AggregateSpecsPlugin.ts](src/AggregateSpecsPlugin.ts) for examples and
more information.

## Disable aggregates

By default, aggregates are created for all tables. This significantly increases
the size of your GraphQL schema, and could also be a security (DoS) concern as
aggregates can be expensive. We recommend that you use the
`disableAggregatesByDefault: true` option to disable aggregates by default, and
then enable them only for the tables you need:

```ts
const middleware = postgraphile(DATABASE_URL, SCHEMAS, {
  // ...
  appendPlugins: [
    // ...
    PgAggregatesPlugin,
  ],

  graphileBuildOptions: {
    // Disable aggregates by default; opt each table in via the `@aggregates` smart tag
    disableAggregatesByDefault: true,
  },
});
```

Enable aggregates for a specific table:

```json
"class": {
  "my_schema.my_table": {
    "tags": {
      "aggregates": "on"
    }
  }
}
```

or:

```sql
COMMENT ON TABLE my_schema.my_table IS E'@aggregates on';
```

You also can keep aggregates enabled by default, but disable aggregates for
specific tables:

```json
"class": {
  "my_schema.my_table": {
    "tags": {
      "aggregates": "off"
    }
  }
}
```

or:

```sql
COMMENT ON TABLE my_schema.my_table IS E'@aggregates off';
```
